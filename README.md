# Projects


This repository contains PCB drawings I have created for various projects.


1. [Wireless Security Board](https://github.com/mertalisenturk/pcb-s/blob/main/Wireless%20Security%20Board)

  The card designed in this project is a security card that monitors the movement and temperature of the environment. The data can be transferred to the user via USB interface or wirelessly. The card works with 220V AC mains. STM32F103C8 series processor was used in the project.


2. [Room Climate Clock Wifi](https://github.com/mertalisenturk/pcb-s/blob/main/Room%20Climate%20Clock%20Wifi)

  In this project, a clock is designed to measure the temperature and humidity values of the environment. This clock is powered by type c. In addition, the data obtained can be transferred to the user via wifi. ESP32-WROOM-32E was used in the project.
