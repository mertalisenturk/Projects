In this project, one USB port is multiplexed into 4 sub-ports using the USB2514 integrated circuit. The project supports USB2.0 and provides 600mA and 5 volt output. The required power is supplied by a 5 volt type c connector.  There is ESD protection for each port. Power to the ports is distributed by a MIC2095 load switch. The ports can also be enabled or disabled with the physical switch on the board.
